This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  The error occurs when a non-numeric user ID is passed to the route, resulting in a server-side error.  The solution includes input validation and comprehensive error handling to prevent such issues and provide informative responses to the client.
